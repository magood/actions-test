Tox: sort of an automation tool for python...  Often for setting up and running testing under many different virtualenvs etc.
You can set up "test matrices" which can allow you to sort of cartesian join a bunch of different testing parameters:

envlist = py{36,37,38}-django{22,30}-{sqlite,mysql}

...creates 12 diferent testing environments.
And can run pytest, black, flake8, etc.


pre-commit.com - a tool to automate the creation of pre-commit hooks for git or others.
install with pip or pipx
Add a configuration defining the tasks to run etc, then add the hooks with a command.

pre-commit vs vs code config:
-pre-commit uses standardized settings shared between the whole team
-pre-commit's config file is kept in the git repo for the project - so everyone should be using the same thing (once set up).

Both tox and pre-commit run on your own computer - and rely on you setting them up.
You can run checks on the server - github/gitlab, etc...  Before PRs are accepted.
-GitHub Actions or GitLab CI, common free tools.

GitHub Actions - built into GitHub.
Create a configuration file with a few settings.  Name, when to run ("push"), jobs to run etc...
Jobs run in containers - so specify which image to use ("ubuntu-latest")
